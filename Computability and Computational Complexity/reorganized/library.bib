The total range can be handled only piecemeal; among the pieces are those homomorphisms of the complex whole that we call “abstract theory” or “general principles.” They alone give the bird’s-eye view that enables us to move about in this vast field without losing our bearings.

Violence in Indonesia, and then interconnected slaughters across Latin America, arguably had a bigger hand in shaping today's world, but have been widely overlooked for one important reason: the secret CIA interventions were successful. In 1965, nearly one million unarmed civilians were killed in Indonesia with active U.S. assistance. This was the end of a decade-long attempt to stop the rise of the largest communist party outside the USSR and China. The resulting dictatorship buried the truth until this day, but the massacre shook the world. Left-wing movements radicalized, afraid of suffering the same fate as the unarmed Indonesians, and the world's committed anticommunists - especially in Brazil and Chile - learned from the mass murder, creating terror campaigns named after the Indonesian capital. In this bold and comprehensive new history, building on his reporting for the Washington Post in Southeast Asia, Vincent Bevins uses recently declassified documents, archival research, and countless of hours of interviews to reconstruct this chapter in world history and reveal a hidden legacy that spans the globe. For decades, it's been portrayed that much of the developing world passed naturally, and peacefully, into the US-led capitalist world system.

  date = {1994-01-01},
  abstract = {Various classes of physical devices having adaptive sensors, coordinative parts, and/or effectors are considered with respect to the kinds of informational relations they permit the device to have with its environment. Devices which can evolve their own physical hardware can expand their repertoires of measurements, computations, and controls in a manner analogous to the structural evolution of sensory, coordinative, and effector organs over phylogeny. In particular, those devices which have the capacity to adaptively construct new sensors and effectors gain the ability to modify the relationship between their internal states and the world at large. Such devices in effect adaptively create their own (semantic) categories rather than having them explicitly specified by an external designer. An electrochemical device built in the 1950's which evolved the capacity to sense sound is discussed as a rudimentary exemplar of a class of adaptive, sensor- evolving devices. Such devices could potentially serve as semantically-adaptive front-ends for computationally-adaptive classifiers, by altering the feature primitives (primitive categories) that the classifier operates with. Networks composed of elements capable of evolving new sensors and effectors could evolve new channels for inter-element signalling by creating new effector-sensor combinations between elements. The new channels could be formed orthogonal to pre-existing ones, in effect increasing the dimensionality of the signal space. Such variable-dimension signalling networks might potentially lead to more flexible modes of information processing and storage. Devices having the means to both choose their sensors (primitive perceptual categories) and effectors (primitive action categories) as well as the coordinative mappings between the two sets would acquire a degree of epistemic autonomy not yet found in contemporary devices.

  abstract = {Hierarchical adaptability theory provides a tool for analyzing the mechanisms and processes that living systems use to survive in uncertain or unknown environments. Adaptability is based on the use of information about the environment to select from a repertoire of possible behaviors. The principle of biological compensation states that restrictions on one part of this repertoire (e.g. on genetic plasticity) must be compensated by expansions of other parts (e.g. neurobehavioral plasticity), by an increase in computing power, or by a decrease in niche space. The tradeoflprinciple asserts that programmability is incompatible with high evolutionary plasticity and efficient use of computational resources. Together these two principles imply that the increasing use of programmable computing power in modern societies can have an adaptability decreasing effect that would put humans in the position of disturbance-absorbing homeostats for computers. Computers can benefit society, but whether they do so in any particular case depends on a sensitive respect for the tradeoffs elucidated by adaptability theory.},

The first concerns a variation of the random oracle hypothesis posed by Bennett and Gill after they showed that relative to a randomly chosen oracle, P not equal NP with probability 1. This hypothesis was quickly disproven in several ways, most famously in 1992 with the result that IP equals PSPACE, in spite of the classes being shown unequal with probability 1. Here we propose a variation of what it means to be ``large'' using the Ellentuck topology. In this new context, we demonstrate that the set of oracles separating NP and co-NP is not small, and obtain similar results for the separation of PSPACE from PH along with the separation of NP from BQP. We demonstrate that this version of the hypothesis turns it into a sufficient condition for unrelativized relationships, at least in the three cases considered here. Second, we example the descriptive complexity of the classes of oracles providing the separations for these various classes, and determine their exact placement in the Borel hierarchy.},

  abstract = {The concept of emergence is used in a variety of scientific fields and disciplines to denote an even wider variety of phenomena. This has resulted in a plethora of perspectives and treatments. The diversity of phenomena going under the moniker of emergence raises the question of what these phenomena have in common and whether different types of emergence can be distinguished on general grounds. Since emergence is recognised in so many different fields as a relevant concept, it would be useful to have a general conceptual framework that allows a treatment of emergence without explicit reference to the specific underlying mechanism. This article aims to provide a general framework in which emergence can be addressed. For this a new concept, the conjugate, is introduced and the place of the observer relative to the system is given a renewed appreciation. Since the framework abstracts from the underlying interactions, emergence in different types of systems can be compared and discussed on equal terms. Reframing emergence in this way leads to a typology of emergences that is both illuminating and integrative In the elaboration the concepts and different types of emergence are discussed and compared with other treatments and typologies of emergence in the literature. Examples from various fields are given to illustrate the theoretical discourse. Furthermore applications of the concepts and typology to social systems, evolution, and co-evolution in ecosystems will be given It will be concluded that many apparently different views and treatments of emergence can be restated and compared within the framework presented in this article.},

  abstract = {Software deployment is the set of activities related to getting  software components to work on the machines of end users. It includes  activities such as installation, upgrading, uninstallation, and so on.  Many tools have been developed to support deployment, but they all  have serious limitations with respect to correctness. For instance,  the installation of a component can lead to the failure of previously  installed components; a component might require other components that  are not present; and it is generally difficult to undo deployment  actions. The fundamental causes of these problems are a lack of  isolation between components, the difficulty in identifying the  dependencies between components, and incompatibilities between  versions and variants of components.    This thesis describes a better approach based on a purely functional  deployment model, implemented in a deployment system called Nix.  Components are stored in isolation from each other in a Nix store.  Each component has a name that contains a cryptographic hash of all  inputs that contributed to its build process, and the content of a  component never changes after it has been built. Hence the model is  purely functional.    This storage scheme provides several important advantages. First, it  ensures isolation between components: if two components differ in any  way, they will be stored in different locations and will not overwrite  each other. Second, it allows us to identify component dependencies.  Undeclared build time dependencies are prevented due to the absence of  "global" component directories used in other deployment systems.  Runtime dependencies can be found by scanning for cryptographic hashes  in the binary contents of components, a technique analogous to  conservative garbage collection in programming language  implementation. Since dependency information is complete, complete  deployment can be performed by copying closures of components under  the dependency relation.    Developers and users are not confronted with components' cryptographic  hashes directly. Components are built automatically from Nix  expressions, which describe how to build and compose arbitrary  software components; hashes are computed as part of this process.  Components are automatically made available to users through "user  environments", which are synthesised sets of activated components.  User environments enable atomic upgrades and rollbacks, as well as  different sets of activated components for different users.    Nix expressions provide a source-based deployment model. However,  source-based deployment can be transparently optimised into binary  deployment by making pre-built binaries (keyed on their cryptographic  hashes) available in a shared location such as a network server. This  is referred to as transparent source/binary deployment.    The purely functional deployment model has been validated by applying  it to the deployment of more than 278 existing Unix packages. In  addition, this thesis shows that the model can be applied naturally to  the related activities of continuous integration using build farms,  service deployment and build management.},

The method can help to approximate abrupt and thus unpredictable regime shifts, even though it may be constrained by stochastics and require a bit more experimentation in selecting suitable variables for making it work in ABMs.},

  doi = {10.7551/mitpress/2260.001.0001},
  abstract = {This is the engaging story of a moment of transformation in the human sciences, a detailed account of a remarkable group of people who met regularly from 1946 to 1953 to explore the possibility of using scientific ideas that had emerged in the war years (cybernetics, information theory, computer theory) as a basis for interdisciplinary alliances. The Macy Conferences on Cybernetics, as they came to be called, included such luminaries as Norbert Wiener, John von Neumann, Margaret Mead, Gregory Bateson, Warren McCulloch, Walter Pitts, Kurt Lewin, F. S. C. Northrop, Molly Harrower, and Lawrence Kubie, who thought and argued together about such topics as insanity, vision, circular causality, language, the brain as a digital machine, and how to make wise decisions. Heims, who met and talked with many of the participants, portrays them not only as thinkers but as human beings. His account examines how the conduct and content of research are shaped by the society in which it occurs and how the spirit of the times, in this case a mixture of postwar confidence and cold-war paranoia, affected the thinking of the cybernetics group. He uses the meetings to explore the strong influence elite groups can have in establishing connections and agendas for research and provides a firsthand took at the emergence of paradigms that were to become central to the new fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science. In his joint biography of John von Neumann and Norbert Wiener, Heims offered a challenging interpretation of the development of recent American science and technology. Here, in this group portrait of an important generation of American intellectuals, Heims extends that interpretation to a broader canvas, in the process paying special attention to the two iconoclastic figures, Warren McCulloch and Gregory Bateson, whose ideas on the nature of the mind/brain and on holism are enjoying renewal today. Steve J. Heims, once a research physicist, has devoted his attention to the history of twentieth century science for the past two decades. The open access edition of this book was made possible by generous funding from Arcadia – a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin.},

First published in 1867 as the beginning of an ambitious but unfinished six-volume series, Marx would only see the first volume published in his lifetime with two more published posthumously by Friedrich Engels, this work extensively attempts to expose and explain the capitalist mode of production and the class struggles embedded within it. Capital was written while Marx was exiled in England, and many of the examples he uses to illustrate private property and its social relations are derived from his time there. Ultimately, this work argues that capitalism would create a divide between wealth and general welfare, and the solution was the replacement of capitalism with a system of common possession in regards to the means of production. Marx's work gained wide readership in a very short span of time, proving highly influential in Russia, Europe, and eventually the rest of the world. Presented here in this edition is the first volume printed on a premium acid-free paper."--Back cover},

The focus of this 2006 book is to demonstrate to the reader that the adaptive landscape concept can be put into actual analytical practice through the usage of theoretical morphospaces - geometric spaces of both existent and non-existent biological form - and to demonstrate the power of the adaptive landscape concept in understanding the process of evolution. The adaptive landscape concept further allows us to take a spatial approach to the concepts of natural selection, evolutionary constraint and evolutionary development. For that reason, this book relies heavily on spatial graphics to convey the concepts developed within these pages, and less so on formal mathematics.},

Here I review definitions of novelty including its relationship to homology. I then discuss how ontogenetic perspectives may allow us to move beyond current roadblocks in our understanding of the mechanics of innovation. Specifically, I explore the roles of canalization, plasticity and threshold responses during development in generating a reservoir of cryptic genetic variation free to drift and accumulate in natural populations. Environmental or genetic perturbations that exceed the buffering capacity of development can then release this variation, and, through evolution by genetic accommodation, result in rapid diversification, recurrence of lost phenotypes as well as the origins of novel features. I conclude that, in our quest to understand the nature of innovation, the nature of development deserves to take center stage.},

  abstract = {Cryptic genetic variation (CGV) is genetic variation that normally has little or no effect on phenotype but that, under atypical conditions that were rare in the history of a population, generates heritable phenotypic variation. Cryptic variants are little exposed to selection and may thus accumulate neutrally.CGV has long provided a theoretical explanation for the presence of standing genetic variation in wild populations that is available to fuel adaptation to new conditions. Early work in Drosophila melanogaster, starting with Waddington's classic experiments, showed that such variation exists and can be 'captured' by selection in a process called genetic assimilation.The mechanisms that conceal CGV are ordinary, familiar genetic phenomena, including dominance, epistasis and gene-by-environment interactions. The ubiquity of these phenomena indicates that CGV is a common feature of populations.CGV is closely related to concepts of robustness and canalization. However, although canalization will promote accumulation of CGV, such variation can accumulate under neutral conditions, and its presence is not necessarily evidence of canalization or robustness.Experimental settings that reveal CGV include production of aberrant phenotypes following inhibition of Hsp90 activity in many different systems; genetic background effects for specific mutations; epistasis in quantitative trait locus mapping populations; genetic modifiers of Mendelian diseases in humans; and increases in additive genetic variance when populations are exposed to novel environments.In principle, CGV can strongly influence the ability of natural populations to adapt to new conditions. Recent experiments have hinted at this potential, and this research field is poised for major advances in the near future.CGV may be playing an important part in the emergence of complex human diseases, but there is currently limited empirical evidence for this hypothesis.},

Some 2,000 years ago, Aristotle had already studied domains as varied as marine biology and the political organization of towns. But, it is our present situation, rather, which is, in a sense, unique. When one thinks of complex phenomena, one immediately thinks of biology, society, economics, or areas of this kind, and when one thinks about simple phenomena, the repeatable experiments of physics and chemistry and the domain of planetary motion are what spring naturally to mind. The remarkable feature of our time is that the gap between these two sets of phenomena has narrowed dramatically.},

Rather, we argue that complex and simple systems are of a fundamentally different character, and that the distinctions between ‘simple’ and ‘complex’ raise some basic issues for theoretical science in general, and for physics and biology in particular. Our discussion is couched in terms of the class (or better, the category) of mathematical images which a given natural system may have, and the relations between these images. Essentially, we define a simple system as: (a) a system whose mathematical images are dynamical systems (i.e. dual structures consisting of a set of states, and superimposed dynamical laws or equations of motion) and (b) this class contains a unique maximal image, which behaves like a free object (i.e. all other images are homomorphic images of the maximal one). A complex system is one which possesses mathematical images which are not dynamical systems. In particular, there is no maximal description of a complex system. We suggest a number of specific examples of complex systems and their class of mathematical images. The behaviours of complex systems are contrasted with those of simple counterparts. We point out in particular that contemporary physics is essentially the science of simple systems, and is neither directly applicable nor adequate for natural systems, like organisms, which are not simple. In effect, we are arguing that the problems associated with complex systems, particulary in biology, pose problems for contemporary physics at least as serious as those posed by e.g. atomic spectra or chemical bonding in the last century.},
